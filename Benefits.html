  <hr style="color: blue;">
  <h2 style="color:aquamarine; font-family: 'Londrina Outline', cursive; font-size:30px; ">The FOUR different stages of fasting</h2>
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Bungee Shade', cursive; color:palegreen;">stage 1</h3>
  <P style="font-size: 20px;">during the first few days of fasting both blood sugar level and blood pressure drops, the body starts the cleansing process</P>
  <h3 style="color:lightblue; font-family: 'Bungee Shade', cursive;">stage 2</h3>
  <P style="font-size: 20px;">the body becomes accustomed to the fasting schedule and the digestive system is able to rest. The digestive system focuses its energy on cleansing the body and healing the cells as the white blood cells in the body start to become more active. During this stage the organs start their repair process as well. </P>
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Bungee Shade', cursive; color:lemonchiffon;">stage 3</h3>
  <P style="font-size: 20px;">By the third stage energy levels will have increased, your mind is able to concentrate better and an overall feeling of wellness overtakes you. During fasting the bodys healing process becomes a lot more effecient and so the body repairs any damaged cells during this stage. during this stage the colon, liver, kidney, lungs and skin are detoxing by eliminating toxins. </P>
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Bungee Shade', cursive; color: pink;">stage 4</h3>
  <P style="font-size: 20px;">During the last 10 days of fasting in Ramadan, the body has become accustomed to the fasting process. the body becomes more energetic and you experience improved memory and concentration. At this stage, the organs are finishing up their healing process and once all toxins are removed the bodys is able to function at its maximum capacity. </P>

  <h2 style="color:aquamarine; font-family: 'Londrina Outline', cursive; font-size:30px;">some detailed benefits</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">When we fast, the body does not have its usual access to glucose, forcing the cells to resort to other means and materials to produce energy. As a result, the body begins gluconeogenesis, a natural process of producing its own sugar. The liver helps by converting non-carbohydrate materials like lactate, amino acids, and fats into glucose energy. Because our bodies conserve energy during fasting, our basal metabolic rate (the amount of energy our bodies burn while resting) becomes more efficient, thereby lowering our heart rate and blood pressure.<br><br>

Ketosis, another process that occurs later into the fast cycle, happens when the body burns stored fat as its primary power source. This is the ideal mode for weight loss and balancing blood sugar levels.<br><br>

Fasting puts the body under mild stress, which makes our cells adapt by enhancing their ability to cope. In other words, they become strong. This process is similar to what happens when we stress our muscles and cardiovascular system during exercise. As with exercise, our body can only grow stronger during these processes when there is adequate time to rest and recover. Thatâ€™s why short-term fasting is recommended.</p>
